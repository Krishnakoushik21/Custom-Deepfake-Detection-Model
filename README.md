# ðŸŽ­ Deepfake Detection using CNN + BiLSTM + Attention

This project implements a custom deepfake detection pipeline that combines spatial and temporal modeling. It is designed to generalize across manipulation techniques (e.g., DeepFake GANs, FaceSwap) and remains robust to video compression.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- CNN backbone for fine-grained spatial feature extraction
- BiLSTM to model temporal dependencies across frames
- Attention mechanism to focus on suspicious frames
- Confidence scoring and augmentations for real-world robustness
